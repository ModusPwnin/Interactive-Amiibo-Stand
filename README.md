Interactive-Amiibo-Stand
========================

*** I will only be updating "Amiibo Stand" with new characters from now on ***

Here is the code I'm currently using for my Amiibo stand!

v1 will recognize an Amiibo and play a sound file once.

v2 will do the same as v1, but if the Amiibo is left on the stand it will play a different sound file on loop until   the Amiibo is taken off.

v3 Has the same functionality as v2, but will recognize which character an Amiibo is without using a UID. This means that there are no extra steps to take once the code is uploaded to the Arduino.

They all require the Waveshield libraries:   https://code.google.com/p/wavehc/ 
as well as the NFC libraries:        https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C

Enjoy!
