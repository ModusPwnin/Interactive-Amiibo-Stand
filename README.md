Interactive-Amiibo-Stand
========================

Here is the code I'm currently using for my Amiibo stand! There are currently 2 versions, v1 and v2.

V1 will recognize an Amiibo and play a sound file once.

V2 will do the same as v1, but if the Amiibo is left on the stand it will play a different sound file on loop until   the Amiibo is taken off.

They both require the Waveshield libraries:   https://code.google.com/p/wavehc/ 
as well as the Adafruit NFC libraries:        https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C

Thanks!
